		<div class="about">
			<h1>About</h1>
			<p>My name is Chris Comiskey, and I'm a statistics PhD student at Oregon State University (OSU). My research focuses on 
				modelling spatial big data (in baseball!), and creating innovative heat maps for visualizing spatial data.
				As an M.S. student at OSU, I studied trend detection techniques in autocorrelated hydrologic time series.
				I live in Corvallis, OR with my wife Betsy, and my two awesome kiddos Alix (3.5 yrs) and Ewan (1 yr). 
				In my free time I like to read and watch Netlix/Amazon Prime/Hulu with Betsy.</p>
