		<div class="about">
			<h1>About</h1>
			<p>My name is Chris Comiskey, and I'm a statistics PhD student at Oregon State University (OSU). My PhD research 
				focuses on modelling spatial big data (in baseball!), 
				and creating innovative heat maps and Shiny apps for visualizing spatial data.
				My M.S. research explored effective sample size estimation 
				for trend detection in autocorrelated hydrologic time series.
				I live in Corvallis, OR with my wife Betsy, 
				and my two awesome kiddos, three-year-old Alix and one-year-old Ewan. 
				In my free time I like to read and watch shows on Netlix/Amazon/Hulu with Betsy.</p>
